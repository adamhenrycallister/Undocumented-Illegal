# "Illegal Immigrant" vs. "Undocumented Immigrant"

Drawing on data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English and a survey experiment conducted in April of 2019, I test the theory that using the term "illegal immigrant" instead of "undocumented immigrant" causes people to favor more restrictive immigration policies and dehumanize immigrants.

Check out the "IllegalUndocumented.ipynb" file to see the results of my analysis.
